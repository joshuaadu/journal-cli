# Overview
This project is a command-line journaling application built in Go. 
The primary goal of this software is to demonstrate core Go concepts such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, structs, pointers, structuring projects,
handling user input via CLI, and applying the language's modular design through packages. 
The project showcases how to build a simple, interactive journaling tool that can be extended to persist entries and stores entries in JSON files and to other interfaces like web or mobile apps in the future.

The journaling application allows users to create and list journal entries with the capacity to extend to list, update, and delete and view journal entries. The entries are saved in a JSON file, ensuring data persistence across program executions. This project has been designed to be extensible, with a modular architecture that separates the concerns of command-line interaction and data storage.

The purpose of building this software is to improve my understanding of Goâ€™s language syntax, best practices for project organization, and how to implement interactivity in a command-line application. 
Additionally, the project explores designing a future-proof architecture that could be extended to other interfaces, such as web apps.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
